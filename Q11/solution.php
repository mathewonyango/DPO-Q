<!-- Designing an auto-scaling setup in AWS for a PHP application with fluctuating traffic involves utilizing several AWS services and features to ensure scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Here's a high-level architecture and the services/features involved:

1. Amazon EC2: Use EC2 instances to host the PHP application. Deploy the application on multiple instances across different availability zones for redundancy.

2. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Configure an ELB to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. ELB automatically scales with the traffic load and helps maintain high availability.

3. Auto Scaling Groups: Create Auto Scaling Groups to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand. Configure scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization or requests per second.

4. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): For database needs, utilize RDS to host the database instance. RDS provides scalability, automated backups, and high availability.

5. Amazon CloudWatch: Use CloudWatch to monitor various metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, and request latency. Set up alarms to trigger scaling actions based on predefined thresholds.

6. AWS Lambda: You can use Lambda functions to perform specific tasks such as cleanup, data processing, or triggering certain actions based on events. For example, you can use Lambda to trigger scaling actions based on custom logic or events.

7. Amazon CloudFront: Optionally, integrate CloudFront for content delivery and caching to improve the performance of the PHP application.
